📊 Project Goal
This dashboard was created to help business owners monitor daily sales performance and identify the highest-selling product categories.

🛠️ What I Did:
Data Transformation: Cleaned the raw sales data using Power Query.

DAX Calculations: Created measures for Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Profit Margin.


💡Key Insights 
Quarterly Performance: "The analysis reveals a strong sales performance in Q1, followed by a gradual decline towards the end of the year, suggesting a high demand during the first quarter."

Product Analysis: "Identified the top-performing categories that drive the initial surge in revenue during the early months."

Business Opportunity: "The data indicates a need for strategic marketing interventions in the second half of the year to stabilize the sales trend."
